                    <h2>All About Me:</h2>
                    <p>As a mechanical engineer, I love designing devices, creating things with my hands, and finding unique solutions to everyday problems. Outside of school I enjoy doing triathlons (I am on the tri team here at Cal!), going on hikes and going to the city. I also work as a barista (yay coffee).</p>

                <h3>Project 1: Windmill Tower Base</h3>
                <img class="projpic" src="Windmill.png" alt="">
                <p>The goal of this project was to create a base for a windmill that would be able to withstand a great deal of force while having minimal volume. My approach to this project was based on simplicity and using strength of basic geometric figures to my advantage. Additionally, I wanted to consider that wind speed increases with height so I aimed to create a taller design without compromising strength and stability.</p>

                <h3>Project 2: Triathlon Helmet Stand</h3>
                <img class="projpic" src="Helmet.png" alt="">
                <p>For this project I wanted to address the issue that many triathletes like myself face while racing. Oftentimes it is difficult to place your helmet in a location where it will not roll away or get in the way of others but is still conveniently accessible. The design for this project was mainly focused on being portable, lightweight, and easily assembled and disassembled. The dish feature is measured to fit most common bike helmets, and the hooks take advantage of the air vents used in many helmet designs to fix the it in place. The device is secured around a bike frame, bike rack or bag using two snap hook mechanisms so that it is securely attached but can still be easily removed.</p>

                <h3>Project 3: Spring-free Claw Clip</h3>
                <img class="projpic" src="Clip.png" alt="">
                <p>For this project, I created a design that is my take on an aesthetic alternative to hair elastics but, unlike normal clips, does not contain a spring which can tear out hair. I wanted the design to be able to accommodate various hair lengths and hair types. I approached this project by focusing on minimalism and efficiency. The mechanism which keeps the clip closed is a snap hook. This feature allows longer and thicker hair to be held as the clip is no longer reliant on the strength of a small spring.</p>

            <h2>Personal Goals:</h2>
            <p>One of my personal goals for this year is to create more personal projects. Through these projects I hope to expand my knowledge of device design and prototyping and manufacturing processes. My goals this year in terms of triathlon are to compete in at least four races. Lastly, I hope to gain a lot of coding skills!</p>
